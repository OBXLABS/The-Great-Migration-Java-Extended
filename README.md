# The-Great-Migration-java-extended

## Extended

This version of The Great Migration is made for display on Concordia University's Visualization Wall, a 3 x 9 monitor touchscreen matrix.

It features slight modifications to the codebase, with the purpose of ensuring proper rendering at high resolutions. Additionally, some modifications to the "beast" instantiation and rendering have been made in order to correct design concerns that were not adressed in previous concerns.

More specifically: changes to background resolution, variation in beast sizes, variation is spray text, and movement of magnification of beasts' bodies.

The non-extended original repository, with java code and PQLabs touchscreen details, can be found here: https://github.com/OBXLABS/The-Great-Migration-java
